This is an in-class exercise. An exercise page like this one will contain a brief description but is intended to be supplemented by discussion during our meeting time. Complete the exercise to the best of your ability in the time given. Feel free to talk with other students as you work, and do not be afraid to ask questions. Aim to complete as much as possible during our meeting and continue to work at home to finish, but you need not hand it in.

## Learning Objectives

:::success Objectives
This exercise should help you practice with:
* GUI testing
* Selenium tool
:::

## Answer the following questions

* What are the pros and cons of manual GUI Testing?
* What are the pros and cons of capture-then-replay GUI testing?
* What is Page Object Desing Pattern?
* What is the most efficient way (i.e., requires least DOM traversal) of selecting/locating an html item? What is the worst? 

## Task 1

1. Follow the instructions in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/selenium.html) to create a `Selenium` project in `Intellij`. Then, write separate test cases using Selenium Web Driver to automate each of the followings:

    * Visit `https://www.allrecipes.com/` -> locate the search bar -> type in `tiramisu` -> click `search` -> verify the title of the page contains the word `tiramisu`
    * ~~Visit `https://www.allrecipes.com/` -> select `Join Now` menu-> click on `Join  Now` -> verify the page title is exactly `Sign Up`~~
    * Visit `https://www.allrecipes.com/` -> click on ~~`Air Fryer Recipes`~~`Air Fryer Magic` -> click on one of the listed recipes -> verify the word `salt` exist somewhere in the recipe/page
    * Visit `https://www.allrecipes.com/` -> take a screen shot and save it in a file named `allrecipescom.png`

2. Now refactor your code to use Page Object design pattern. Create a class named "MainPage" in which you have all your selectors of the main page (i.e., https://www.allrecipes.com/) as well as a method named `search` that takes a String named query as input and conducts a search with the query string.

For practice with Selenium IDE, try to replicate the above test cases on Selenium IDE.
