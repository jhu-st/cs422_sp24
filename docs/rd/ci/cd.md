title: Continuous Delivery

:::danger final words
In the past few sections, we created a fully funcitioning continuous integration & continuous deployment pipeline using Github Actions and Dockers. In reality, you would most likely have a continuous delivery step as well where you release the project into production. For a web app, for example, this would be deploying the app online to the web once the build, test, and deploy steps are passed. For a mobile app, this would be releasing to the apple/play store.
