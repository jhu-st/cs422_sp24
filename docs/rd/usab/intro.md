title: What is usability testing?
---

Usability testing is a method used to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a product, such as a website, application, or physical device, by testing it with representative users. The primary goal of usability testing is to identify any usability issues, understand how users interact with the product, and gather feedback for improvements.

:::tip Simple definition of usability
"If something is *usable*, s person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it's worth!"

“Usability is about people and how they understand and use things, not technology”

During a usability test, a moderator or researcher typically guides participants through a series of tasks while observing their behavior and collecting data. The participants are often representative of the target user group for the product. They may be asked to perform specific actions, provide feedback on their experience, or express their thoughts aloud as they navigate the product.

The process typically involves the following steps:

Planning: Defining the objectives, scope, and tasks for the usability test, as well as identifying the target user group and recruiting participants.

Test Design: Creating a test plan that outlines the scenarios, tasks, and metrics that will be used to evaluate the product's usability.

Test Execution: Conducting the usability test by facilitating sessions with individual participants. The moderator observes the participants, asks questions, and encourages them to think aloud while interacting with the product.

Data Collection: Gathering both qualitative and quantitative data during the test, such as task completion rates, time taken to complete tasks, observations, and user feedback.

Analysis: Reviewing and analyzing the collected data to identify usability issues, patterns, and insights.

Reporting: Summarizing the findings and presenting them in a clear and actionable manner to stakeholders. This report may include recommendations for improving the product's usability.

Usability testing provides valuable insights into how users perceive and interact with a product, enabling designers and developers to make informed decisions for enhancing its usability, user experience, and overall satisfaction. It helps identify potential pain points, navigation difficulties, and areas for improvement, leading to iterative design and development processes that result in more user-friendly and effective products.
