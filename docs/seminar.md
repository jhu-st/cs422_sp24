## Description

The primary purpose of the seminar component in this course is to expand your knowledge in a specifc area of software testing by self-studying relevant research works in a focused sub-area of software testing and share what you have learned with others. You will need to:
1. Peruse (and contemplate to understand) an existing research work,
1. Write a detailed report in your own words on what you have gained,
1. Prepare and deliver a 25-long presentation. 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpLpiMD0GrbXk-dg_5ZNx-Hdm6M4trxpNcANz0ObXrQ/edit?usp=sharing), you can find a list of recommended topics along with some suggested resources/papers/tools and a summary of what the topic is about. As a team, you will select one topic together and it is on you to decide how you would like to break down the work among the members; the primary goal for all of you is to learn about the topic as much as possible and deliver it by writing a report and making a presentation. 

:::info Scheduling
Once you have finalized your decision on the topic with your teammates, go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15GfzBKWEzRJ8PQ4fiAGdCgTF3AKUZ67y8jQaZLu_q_A/edit?usp=sharing) to schedule your presentation by writing down the topic name along with your names and JHED IDs. <br />

__Important Note 1:__ _Before signing up for a topic, make sure it is not already taken by another group._
__Important Note 2:__ _Only enter the topic and your JHED IDs in the row associated with the date and time slot you are signing up for under the appropriate columns; **everyone has edit access to the document and you must avoid overwriting/changing anything that is already there.**_
:::

:::danger Topic Selection
To avoid duplications and hit on as many different research works as possible, only one team can work on a single suggested topic. **When scheduling your presentation in the above sheet, make sure the topic is not already taken by another group.**
:::

:::tip
If you would like to work on an alternate subject, you need to contact the course instructor as soon as possible to discuss it and acquire approval.

## Preparation

Once you have landed on a subject, you need to decide how you would like to make a seminar as a team on the chosen topic. Feel free to coordinate among yourselves however you would like, but a simple approach is to 1) select the set of papers/resources you would like to dig into, and 2) decide who will be responsible for what paper(s)/resources. You can then set the timelines on when to finish the assigned works and how/when to combine your findings in order to prepare the deliverables as outlined below.

:::caution
Feel free to use any relevant extra resources to prepare your seminar, but at the very least each team member must study and prepare one suggested research paper, or alternatively study and demo a tool. If you would like to study an alternate research paper/tool in place of a suggested paper/tool, make sure to discuss it with the instructor and acquire approval before investing any time/effort.
:::

## Presentation

Each team needs to make a 25-minute in-class presentation. There are no strict formatting requirements on how you structure your presentation, but here is a suggested break-down:

1. __Opening remarks [2-4 minutes]:__ Use this time to motivate the topic and explain clearly in simple terms what exactly is tried to be solved and why it is important to overcome the problem.

2. __Set the stage [2-4 minutes]:__ Use this time to explain any sepific background knowledge and/or context (e.g. definitions, jargons & terminologies, assumptions, etc.) that the audience must know in order to understand the rest of your presentation.

3. __Explain the method(s) [4-9 minutes]:__ Explain clearly and succintly the proposed approach/technique to tackle the problem. 

:::tip
An important thing to note in this part is that you need NOT to get very technical here and present all the math, algorithms, etc. discussed in the paper. Rather, you want to transparently explain in simple terms what the essence of the proposed approach is and how (if?) it really solves the problem. Of course, to be able to do this, you yourself need to have studied the paper(s) in full details and have developed a good understading of it. In other words, for this part, imagine you were the owner the research work you have studied: how would go about selling it to the world? How would you explain it in simple terms such that all your audience would easily understand the importance and impact of your work.
:::

4. __Summarize the results [3-6 minutes]__: Outline the major results. You do not have to include every single evaluation result data; rather, try to present the hightlights of the achieved results. Also, if there are any "threats to the validity" of the data, feel free to briefly mention them in this section.

5. __Closing remarks [2-4 minutes]__: Conclude your talk by sharing the highlights of what you have learned and what your own thoughts are on the subject. Any challenging and/or fun parts in particular?

6. __Q & A [2-4 minutes]__: Make sure to leave some time at the end for questions.


:::caution
All team members must equally (roughly) and actively participate in the presentation delivery.
:::

:::tip
A good presentation makes appropriate use of visuals (e.g. pictures, diagrams, charts, animations etc.) to convery the material. _A presentation filled with text is boring and not as engaging!_
:::

:::tip
Try to make your presentation such that it is all part of one story. This should be at the very least doable for parts 1, 2, and 5 listed above. Having said that, it is understandable the paper(s) each member has worked on might be different so that it is not possible to easily integrate everything into one coherent storyline, in which case feel free to take turns to present your works.
:::

:::tip demo
If there are any associated software tools that are related and/or part of the research work you have studied (that are accessible to use), feel free to include a quick "demo" section in your presentation. This does not need to be anything fancy; it can be just running the software to show how cool it is and showing how it works for a simple scenario! A demo will certainly enhance the quality of your presentation and will be favorably regarded when grading your work.

## Report 

Each team needs to prepare a report based on their learnings on the subject. You can structure the report in any form you deem suitable. As a general guideline, a well-structured report at the very least typically includes the following sections:

1. __Motivation__: State what the problem is and why it is important; that is why we care to study the problem and tackle it by offering new solutions or improving the existing solutions.
1. __Intro__: Set the context and outline the background knowledge that is needed to undersand the problem and the offered solution(s).
1. __Methods__: Describe in details the methods/solutions offered in the works you have studied. Try to convery the essence of the work you have studied in simple, succint, and clear terms. It is important to show in this part you have developed a good understanding of foundation of the research work(s) you have studied by using your own words.
1. __Results:__ Summarize the most important achievements in the presented results in the research work(s) you studied in this part. What you include here would most likely be majorly derived from "Evaluation", "Experimental Results", or the like sections of the paper(s) you have read. Again, use your own words to outline what is/are the primary achieved result(s).
1. __Reflection:__ Use this part to briefly summarize your main thoughts on the problem you studied and what you think is most challenging and/or rewarding about it. Also, describe/list the main questions that remain unanswered in your mind (as related to the topic/prblem), and feel free to include anything else that you like to mention in this part.

:::caution
Avoid unnecessary copy&pasting when preparing the report. The expectation is that you write the report _in your own words_.
:::

:::tip Length and Format
There are not strict restrictions on the length or format of the report. As a very general metric though, your report must not be anything less than 1500 words. Keep in mind though that it is NOT about the quantity; rather, your report will be evaluated based on the quality of your writing and showing that you have genuinely put in effort to develop an understanding of the chosen research work/topic.
:::

:::caution references
Do not forget to include a "Refernce" section to properly cite any referenced work!

## Grading

The grading is based on the overall quality of your report and the presentation. Some of the main factors that will be taken into account are:

1. How well-structured and well-written the report is.
1. The overall quality of the presentation (e.g. slides, demos etc.)
1. How engaging and easy-to-understand the presentation is.
1. Good time management in the presentation.
1. Showing a good understanding of the research works studied as reflected in both the report and presentation.
1. If possible/relevant, have played around and included a demo of relevant tools as part of your presentation.
